Track Fisher Kia Used Inventory
===============================

It's well known fact that, when negotiating a deal, it's advantageous to understand the circumstances of the other party. Victoria and I recently stopped by the local Kia dealership and looked at their used inventory.

Luckily, the site has a handy page tucked away that shows the in-stock inventory and the number of days it's been on the lot: http://www.fisherkia.net/used-inventory-sheet/

I thought it would be helpful to get a feel for how long inventory sits around before being sold, and how it's priced/discounted as time progresses. I'm running `trackFisherKiaUsedInventory.py` every day (via `crontab`) to build a history for later analysis.
